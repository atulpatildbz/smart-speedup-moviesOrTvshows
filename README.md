# Smart Fast Forward for Movies and TV shows

This program provides a way to convert any movie or tv show episode and fast forward it such that parts where noone speaks is sped up, and part where someone is speaking is not.
This allows us to watch a movie quickly and without missing out any dialogues.

Some prerequisites needed:
  - ffmpeg: this is an open source video software to work with video/audio
  - pysrt: this python library is required to work with srt files
  - moviepy: python library for ffmpeg
